1. The syscall() function is being called by usertrap() in kernel/trap.c.
2. The value of p->trapframe->a7 is 0x7 and this means that the process is making a system call to SYS_exec.
3. The previous mode was User Mode because the SPP bit (bit 8) is 0. The output of GDB was 0x200000022.
4.
    `lw	a3,0(zero)`
    a3 register corresponds to num
5. 
    The kernel crashes because it is attempting to dereference a null pointer, which corresponds to the memory address 0. 
    Address 0 is not mapped in either the kernel or user address space. This unmapped address causes a page fault when 
    the kernel attempts to load a value from it, leading to a crash. Yes this is confirmed by the value of scause (0xd)
    because this is indicates a store/amo page fault which happens when the system tries to write to an invalid mem address.
6. The process that was running when the kernel panicked was "initcode" and the pid was 1.
